Analyses for the online Pong task

---

## Description of the experiment

Participants played an online version of the Pong game on their computer. They had to intercept the pong ball after it bounced back from the upper wall using a paddle controlled by their cursor.
A perturbation was applied to the post-bounce trajectory of the ball and the visual tilt of the bouncing wall was manipulated to be consistent or inconsistent with the ball trajectory.

- No perturbation trials
- Perturbation trials, horizontal wall (inconsistent condition)
- Perturbation trials, tilted wall (consistent condition)

### Session 1

- No perturbation
- Trained perturbation

### Session 2

- Trained perturbation
- Untrained perturbation
- No perturbation
